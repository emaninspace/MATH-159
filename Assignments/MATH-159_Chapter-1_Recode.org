You recently collected data in a survey. Students filled out their
student ID, whether they were registered to vote, GPA, and favorite
type of pet. Unfortunately not everyone filled out the survey the same
e.g. some responded no and others NO. You can find the data in
"Recode.csv". Complete the tasks below in groups and turn in one
electronic copy per group. Groups are 5 or smaller. Make sure you note
how you accomplished the task with statcrunch "Stat -> tables -> ..."
and what information you entered and buttons pressed.

1. Write down the steps you used to eecode the data so that all
   responses are the same. For "Registered_to_vote" change it so that
   all of the no's and yes's are the same i.e. "No" and "NO" changed
   to "no". For "Pet" change it so that there is only dog, cat, and
   bird. 
2. Write down the steps to make a distribution of the recoded
   responses.
