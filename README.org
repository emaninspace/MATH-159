* Goals
The goal is to create a shared space for instructors at Ohlone (and
possibly elsewhere) to share statistics resources (assignments,
slides, datasets, etc.).

* Naming System
All files should have a common format. Filnames should start from
least specific (MATH-159) to most specific (Test-1). Use underscores
to separate information. For example the file,
MATH-159_Chapter-1_Section-3.org, meets the guidelines.
